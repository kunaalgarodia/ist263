    <body>
        My name is Kunaal Garodia. I am an applied data analytics major interested in finding patterns and answering questions related to sports, primarily basketball. I am also open to applying my data analysis skills to other fields, but most of my current experience involves sports. I have basic coding skills in Python, R, and SQL and am fluent in the Adobe suite of products. Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball, video games, and watching movies. One of my favorite movies of all time is C'mon C'mon, a heartfelt drama about a radio journalist who goes on a cross-country trip with his nephew. It doesn't sound as interesting on the surface, but I guarantee it is worth the watch.
