        <p>
            My name is Kunaal Garodia. I am an applied data analytics major interested in finding patterns and answering questions related to sports, primarily basketball. 
            I am also open to applying my data analysis skills to other fields, but most of my current experience involves sports. 
            I have basic coding skills in Python, R, and SQL and am fluent in the Adobe suite of products. 
            Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball, video games, and watching movies. 
            One of my favorite movies of all time is <strong>C'mon C'mon</strong>, a heartfelt drama about a radio journalist who goes on a cross-country trip with his nephew. 
            It doesn't sound as interesting on the surface, but I guarantee it is worth the watch. Some of my other favorite movies (in no particular order) are:

            <li>Parasite</li>
            <li>Perfect Strangers</li>
            <li>The Peanut Butter Falcon</li>
        </ul>
